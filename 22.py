- Begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. 
Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
multiply this value by its alphabetical position 
in the list to obtain a name score.

- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, 
COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, 
is the 938th name in the list. 
So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
